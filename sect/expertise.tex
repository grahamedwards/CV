Under the advisorship of lab director Prof.~Terry Blackburn, I was partially responsible for the operation and maintenance of this multi-user clean lab facility, including:
	\begin{itemize} 
	\item Maintenance and operation of mass spectrometery and wet chemistry labs.
	\item Training and supporting researchers in chemical and mass spectrometric methods.
	\item Preparation, measurement, and reporting of isotopic analyses of geologic and biomineral material.
	\item Procurement and preparation of lab consumables.
